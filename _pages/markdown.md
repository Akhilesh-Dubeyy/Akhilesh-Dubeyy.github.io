* Graduated from Bachelors (Honours) Physics Program (2018-21 batch), Rank 4 in Jamia Millia Islamia which is in top 3 rank university in India.
* Ranked under top 23% in Joint Admission test for Masters out of total 14298 candidates.
* Cleared several IBM Quantum Challenges:
  * Spring 2022<br>
    Got the badge for demonstrating  an understanding of how to create circuits that perform measurements mid-circuit and dynamically decide what the next steps should be and implementing dynamic circuits in the context of iterative phase estimation, quantum teleportation, and error correction.
    * The ability to use Qiskit to perform simulations of complex problems. Enhanced understanding of how to setup, analyze, and compare quantum simulations against their
      classical computing counterparts, with a focus on many-body and fermionic systems.
