* Learned to formulate a basic problem that is amenable to full analytical solution.

* Translated the problem into a form that can be analyzed on a computer, first by visual tools followed by
more sophisticated computational tools.

* Designed complementary computational approaches whose results can be subjected to test against the analytical solutions, thus building confidence and making transparent both the methods.

* Exploited the confidence developed to tackle problems that are not amenable to a full analytical solution.
