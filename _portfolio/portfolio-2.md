* Developed a quantum maze game which is a classical ludo inspired game that allows beginners to delve
into the basic concepts of different quantum gates. The dice roll is symbolised as a quantum measurement
of a circuit with two hadamard gates. The winning move involves applying a suitable quantum gate to a
bloch sphere to bring it back to state 0. It is a two player game with both of them playing alternatively to
reach the winning destination.
