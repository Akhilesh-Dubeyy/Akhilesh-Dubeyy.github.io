* Published the project in  [Fundamental Science Winter School 2023.](https://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/2777794) 

* Investigated systematic methods to generate a desired probability distribution from a quantum circuit functionality by creating a high-level circuit model.

* Learned to produce a desired optimal quantum circuit out of many possible combinations that matches from given random probability generator output.

* Continuing the project under Wolfram Research for bench marking on real quantum computers
