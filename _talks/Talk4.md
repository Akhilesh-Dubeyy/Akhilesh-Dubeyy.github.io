* Attended 3 weeks school and completed the [project](https://www.notebookarchive.org/predicting-the-electron-invariant-mass-from-the-cern-dielectron-collision-data--2022-01-5kbhz3u/) under a mentor.

* Explored various features of the di-electron collision using rigorous data analysis tools and used neural network to test dataset for prdicting the invariant mass of the electron.
