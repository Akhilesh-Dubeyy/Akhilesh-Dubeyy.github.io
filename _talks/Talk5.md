* Submitted as a project in Bachelors final semester.

* Employed the different computational methods using python to solve numerically solving the Schrodinger Equation.

* Solved finite square well bound state of Harmonic Oscillator using Taylors method, Discritization, Forward and Backward first order differential(first & second order), finite difference method and Matrix representation.
