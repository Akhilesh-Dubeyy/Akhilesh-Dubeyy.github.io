* Presented and Published the project in [Wolfram Summer School 2022](https://notebookarchive.org/tic-tac-toe-a-quantum-probabilistic-approach--2022-07-9ozi0wh/) under a mentor.

* The project proposes quantum version of Tic-Tac-Toe which accurately resemble the inherent probabilistic nature of the measurement Principle in Quantum Mechanics.

* Aimed at showing the formulation of quantum rules, by using quantum superposition of different states and entanglement from the aid of qutrits and quantum gates representing the whole Game Tree.
