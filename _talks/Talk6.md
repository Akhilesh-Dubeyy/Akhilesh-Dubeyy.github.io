* Combined two techniques of computational ghost imaging and machine learning to identify the object in
effectively less amount of time.

* Implemented the simulation part for various masks used in quantum ghost imaging experiment like
Hadamard, Walsh and obtained results.

* Analyzed more than 3,600 images for training to detect patterns in data for machine learning model and
analysing over 21,600 images with an efficient accuracy and less loss.
