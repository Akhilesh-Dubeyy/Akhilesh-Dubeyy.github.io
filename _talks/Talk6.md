* Mentor: [Dr. Shashi Prabhakar](https://www.prl.res.in/~shaship/#group) [AMOPH Division](https://www.prl.res.in/~shaship/#about)

* [Project](https://stoicodin.github.io/files/SIP 2023 Akhilesh_Dubey.pdf) Combined two techniques of quantum ghost imaging and machine learning to identify the object in
effectively less amount of time.

* Implemented the simulation part for various masks used in quantum ghost imaging experiment like
Hadamard, Walsh and obtained results.

* Analyzed more than 3,600 images for training to detect patterns in data for machine learning model and
analysing over 21,600 images with an efficient accuracy and less loss.

* Performed quantum ghost experiment using SPDC process for single photons using non-linear crystal,dichroic mirror, spatial light modulator, avalanche photo-diode,  Coincidence Counter, Lenses and mirror. Learned about single photon and its intresting other methods for generation like in quntum Key Distribution for teleportation.

* Reconstructed the image generated from the experiment and used machine learning algorithms to detect images.

* Run my machine learning algorithm on High performance Computer(HPC) Cluster ([PARAM VIKRAM 1000](https://www.prl.res.in/prl-eng/paramvikram1000)) for better and efficient results.
