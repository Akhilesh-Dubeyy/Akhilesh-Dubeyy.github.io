## Abstract


The Mach-Zehnder Interferometer (MZI) is a robust quantum optics research tool. We have used it to investigate the behavior of quantum states, namely coherent states and superposition levels. Coherent states with classical-like characteristics are annihilation operator eigenstates with a well-defined phase. Superposition states, on the other hand, are quantum states that exist as a linear combination of several states, each with a matching probability amplitude. One significant use in the area of quantum error correction is the implementation of the Shor code for quantum error correction. It is possible to examine the impact of faults on the logical qubits and perform error correction operations by encoding quantum information into logical qubits using the Shor code.
